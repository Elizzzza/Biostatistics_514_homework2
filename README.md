# Biostat 514/517 Homework 2
#### Instructor: Ken Rice

- Please read the class site for details on appropriate answering of questions. Discussion of the questions with 
other students, TAs, the instructor, or on the class discussion board is permitted, but you should write up your 
own answers in your own words. 
- Upload your answers to the class site – see under course navigation for “Assignments”. 
- Raw code should not appear in your solutions, but include your code (your .R or script file, or equivalent) at the 
end of your submission, as an appendix. As well as making your work reproducible, this helps the grader see 
exactly what you have done – and help with any problems. 

### Q1 – Roles and types of measurements 

Do Vittinghoff et al, Problem 2.1. (If you haven’t already downloaded this book, recall it is available with your UWNetID 
login on Springer Link.) 

### Q2 – Roles of measurements, connecting science and statistics 

The class site contains the dataset on salaries, and a description of what it contains and why it was collected. For each of 
the scientific questions in that description, briefly characterize the type of statistical question as clustering cases, 
clustering variables, quantifying distributions within groups, comparing distributions across groups, or prediction, 
identifying any variable whose distribution is of interest and any groups that might be being compared. In your answer 
for each scientific question, state which variable(s) you would use, and if necessary any subsets of the data you would 
consider for the analysis. 

Note you should assume the data are error-free. Also note that you are not required to do any analysis, though you are 
welcome to examine the data if you find this helpful. 

### Q3 – Displaying data 
The following display is an early infographic – a display of data that is meant to be eye-catching as well as informative. It 
displays the 1985-1990 market share of Sotheby’s and Christie’s, two competing auction houses;  
 
a. What information is conveyed by the horizontal positions of the pie charts? 
b. What information is conveyed by the vertical positions of the pie charts? 
c. Suggest a more straightforward graph, that would convey exactly the same information but with less 
redundancy. You may give a written description of the graph you would plot, or actually plot it; either earns full 
credit. 

### Q4 – 1D Summaries 

*Note: before you begin, please read the bullet point above about including your code (e.g. your .R script) as an appendix 
to your answers. Raw code and output should not appear in your written solutions to a, b or c.* 

The bodyfat dataset on the class site contains data on the percent body fat, age, weight, height and ten body 
circumference measurements for 252 adult men.  

a. Using appropriate graphical displays, examine the distribution of the men’s body weights (in pounds). Are there 
unusual observations? If so, are they plausible values? Explain your answers. 

b. Using appropriate graphical displays, examine the distribution of the men’s heights (in inches). Are there 
unusual observations? If so, are they plausible values? Explain your answers. 

c. Give a table with at least three numeric measures of central tendency for the men’s body weights and heights. If 
you found unusual observations in items a. and b., but they were plausible, keep them in the analysis. If any 
unusual observations were not plausible, discard them from the analysis. For both height and weight, your table 
should state how many unusual observations you identified and whether they were plausible. 

### Q5 – Looking ahead 

In preparation for next week’s lecture (Oct 18th-22nd) read slides 2.99-2.175 in Chapter 2. Also read to the end of 
Vittinghoff Chapter 2.
